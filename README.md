A series of Pine scripts featuring 4 indicators I worked on throughout the Autumn of 2023 to Spring 2024.

All of them have been removed from TradingView for no reason provided so publishing them here.

Add the code to a new script, apply to the chart on different timeframes, and see how they work.

Advice: no matter how high the precision is, you'd still have to manage your positions properly to turn it into something valuable; if trading crypto please combine the signals with a fib grid to not get stuck with a short in the middle of a hard pump :)
